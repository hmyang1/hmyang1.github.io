I work as a senior AI researcher at [ADD](https://www.add.re.kr/eps).
Concurrently, I'm a PhD candidate at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and a member of  [Visual Intelligence Lab.](https://vi.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by Prof. [Kuk-Jin Yoon](https://sites.google.com/site/kjyoon/).

My research aims to develop trustworthy visual intelligence which assists decision-making processes regarding real-world problems.
To do this, I research in the interdisciplinary fields of computer vision and machine learning.
My major interests currently lie in robust model training, domain generalization/adaptation, and adversarial robustness.
