I am a PhD candidate at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr). I am a member of the [Visual Intelligence Lab](https://vi.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by Prof. [Kuk-Jin Yoon](https://sites.google.com/site/kjyoon/). 
Concurrently, I work as an AI researcher at [ADD](https://www.add.re.kr).\
\
My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning. I've worked on robust model training, domain generalization/adaptation, and adversarial robustness.

If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.




<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
